# Traffic-Light-Optimization
### About The Project

The aim of this project is to develop a virtual traffic network which can model almost any real world problem in simulation.
The main target is to be able to optimize the traffic flow through a well calculated timing of traffic light changing. This 
would be archived by the use of AI operations working on time series data.
